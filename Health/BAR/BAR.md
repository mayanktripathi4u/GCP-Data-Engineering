# BAR - Backup And Recovery

As a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) healthcare API platform engineer, validating backups and ensuring that you can restore data from Google Cloud Healthcare API stores, such as the HL7v2 and FHIR stores, are crucial tasks. Let's break this down into the required parts and provide solutions.

### 1. Validating Backups for HL7v2 and FHIR Stores

**Validation involves:**
- Checking that the backups have been created successfully.
- Ensuring that the data is consistent and can be restored if needed.

Here’s how you can validate backups:

#### **Using `gcloud` commands**:
To verify that your backups are working, you can check the status of the `hl7v2` or `fhir` store backups by listing and inspecting the backup resources.

- **Check HL7v2 Store backups:**
```bash
gcloud healthcare hl7v2-stores list --location=us-central1 --dataset=YOUR_DATASET

gcloud healthcare hl7v2-stores list --location=us-central1 --dataset=poc_hl7v2_store
```
- **Check FHIR Store backups:**
```bash
gcloud healthcare fhir-stores list --location=us-central1 --dataset=YOUR_DATASET
```

These commands will provide a list of stores. To get more detailed information about a specific store, you can use:
```bash
gcloud healthcare hl7v2-stores describe YOUR_HL7V2_STORE --location=us-central1 --dataset=YOUR_DATASET

gcloud healthcare hl7v2-stores describe HL7V2_STORE_ID --location=us-central1 --dataset=poc_hl7v2_store
```
Or for FHIR stores:
```bash
gcloud healthcare fhir-stores describe YOUR_FHIR_STORE --location=us-central1 --dataset=YOUR_DATASET
```

To validate if the backup was successful, you can check whether the data has been archived or backup jobs are listed in the logs.

#### **Using Python and Google Cloud Healthcare API:**
For more programmatic validation, you can use the Google Cloud Healthcare API client libraries in Python to interact with the stores and backup systems.

Here’s a basic Python script using Google Cloud’s Python Client:

```python
from google.cloud import healthcare_v1
from google.oauth2 import service_account

# Replace with your actual information
project_id = 'your-project-id'
dataset_id = 'your-dataset-id'
hl7v2_store_id = 'your-hl7v2-store-id'
fhir_store_id = 'your-fhir-store-id'
location = 'us-central1'

# Authenticate using a service account
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path-to-your-service-account-key.json')

# Create Healthcare API client
client = healthcare_v1.HealthcareServiceClient(credentials=credentials)

# HL7v2 store validation
hl7v2_store_path = client.hl7v2_store_path(project_id, location, dataset_id, hl7v2_store_id)
hl7v2_store = client.get_hl7v2_store(name=hl7v2_store_path)
print(f'HL7v2 Store Status: {hl7v2_store.name}, {hl7v2_store.state}')

# FHIR store validation
fhir_store_path = client.fhir_store_path(project_id, location, dataset_id, fhir_store_id)
fhir_store = client.get_fhir_store(name=fhir_store_path)
print(f'FHIR Store Status: {fhir_store.name}, {fhir_store.state}')
```

#### **Backup Validation Steps**:
1. Ensure that backups are taken at regular intervals (full every week, incremental every 24 hours).
2. You can verify that backups were successfully created by checking logs or querying for backup metadata.
3. Check if the store is in a valid state and if there are any errors in the backup process.

### 2. What to Do If the 24-Hour Window for Backup Deletion is Crossed?

Google Cloud recommends that the data in your HL7v2 or FHIR store can be restored within **24 hours** of deletion. Once the **24-hour window** has passed, recovery is not guaranteed through Google’s native restore process.

#### **Options After 24 Hours:**

1. **Offload Backups Regularly**:
   To avoid losing data after the 24-hour window, maintain an offsite backup strategy. You should:
   - Use Google Cloud’s **Cloud Storage** to store backups manually (via scheduled exports or scripts).
   - Export the data periodically to Cloud Storage, where it can be safely retained and restored.

   **Example of FHIR store export to Cloud Storage (using gcloud)**:
   ```bash
   gcloud healthcare fhir-stores export \
       --dataset=YOUR_DATASET \
       --fhir-store=YOUR_FHIR_STORE \
       --location=us-central1 \
       --gcs-uri=gs://your-bucket-name/backup/fhir-backup/
   ```

2. **Use Google Cloud’s Versioned Storage for Data Recovery**:
   Enable **Object Versioning** in Google Cloud Storage. This will allow you to recover older versions of objects even after deletion.

   - Enable Object Versioning:
     ```bash
     gsutil versioning set on gs://your-bucket-name
     ```

3. **Third-party Backup Solutions**:
   In cases where Google Cloud's native tools don’t meet your needs (e.g., after 24 hours), you may need to explore third-party backup and restore solutions, such as:
   - **Veeam Backup & Replication**
   - **CloudEndure**
   - **Commvault**: These solutions can integrate with Google Cloud and provide more flexible backup and disaster recovery options.

4. **Manual Backup Strategy**:
   If you need to back up the data manually after the 24-hour window, consider exporting the data to Cloud Storage (as shown earlier) or creating regular snapshots of your data using `gcloud` or Python.

5. **Data Recovery from Logs**:
   If your data is deleted but you have logging enabled (via Cloud Logging), you may still be able to reconstruct some data based on logs. However, this is a last resort and is only feasible for some scenarios.

### 3. General Best Practices for Backup & Restoration Strategy

- **Automate Backup and Export**:
  Ensure that backup jobs are automated to run at the required intervals (e.g., weekly full backups and daily incremental backups). You can use **Cloud Scheduler** to trigger these operations.

- **Test Restorations Regularly**:
  Ensure that you regularly perform restore tests to ensure that your backups are valid and can be restored in case of data loss.

- **Use IAM and Audit Logs**:
  Protect access to backup jobs and logs using proper IAM roles and policies. Make sure audit logs are enabled to track any changes, deletions, or backups.

- **Secure Your Backups**:
  Store your backups securely with encryption at rest. You can leverage Google’s default encryption or manage your own encryption keys using **Cloud KMS**.

#### **Backup Automation (using Python and Cloud Scheduler)**:
Here's an example of a simple Python script that could automate your backup jobs and then schedule it via Cloud Scheduler.

```python
import os
from google.cloud import healthcare_v1
from google.oauth2 import service_account

# Backup HL7v2 Store
def backup_hl7v2_store():
    client = healthcare_v1.HealthcareServiceClient(credentials=service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path-to-your-service-account-key.json'))
    # Trigger backup here

# Backup FHIR Store
def backup_fhir_store():
    client = healthcare_v1.HealthcareServiceClient(credentials=service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path-to-your-service-account-key.json'))
    # Trigger backup here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    backup_hl7v2_store()
    backup_fhir_store()
```

You can schedule this script via **Cloud Scheduler** to trigger at the required intervals.
